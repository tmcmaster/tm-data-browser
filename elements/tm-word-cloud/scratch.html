  George: Care for a smoke, sir?

Edmund: No, thank you, I'm... (he lights his own pipe)

George: Private?

Baldrick: (taking cigarette from George) Oh, thank you, sir.
          (begins to eat the cigarette)

George: Oh, dash and blast all this hanging about, sir! I'm as bored as
        a pacifist pistol. When are we going to see some action?

Edmund: Well, George, I strongly suspect that your long wait for certain
        death is nearly at an end. Surely you must have noticed something
        in the air...

George: Well, yes, of course, but I thought that was Private Baldrick.

Edmund: Unless I'm very much mistaken, soon we will at last be making the
        final Big Push -- that one we've been so looking forward to all
        these years.

George: Well, hurrah with highly polished brass knobs on! About time!

        (phone rings within Baldrick's backpack, Edmund answers it)

Edmund: Hello; the Somme Public Baths -- no running, shouting, or piddling in
        the shallow end. Ah, Captain Darling. Tomorrow at dawn. Oh, excellent.
        See you later, then. Bye. (hangs up) Gentlemen, our long wait is
        nearly at an end. Tomorrow morning, General Insanity Melchett invites
        you to a mass slaughter. We're going over the top.

George: Well, huzzah and hurrah! God Save the King, Rule Britannia,
        and Boo Sucks the Hairy Hun!

Edmund: Or, to put it more precisely: you're going over the top; I'm getting
        out of here. (goes inside dugout)
